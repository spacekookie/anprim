# Anprim

A toy browser-engine which doesn't solve any problems and exists completely disconnected from reality (hence the name *rimshot*). It's my way of learning Rust a bit more intimately and hopefully understand a thing or two about browser design as well.


## What can anprim do

Not much.

 - ✓ Parsing a simple HTML subset
 - ✗ Parsing a simple CSS subset
 - ✗ Create box-layouts from DOM tree
 - ✗ Rendering said box-layouts in less than O(2^n)


## What is out of scope

Anprim will never be able to run javascript because it is a product of civilisation. Also nope nope nope /o\
